## Deliverable I: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

   **Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?**
   
Variables or coefficients that provided a non-random amount of varience were _Ground Clearance_ and _Vehicle Length_. Their p-value is very small which means that the probability of random amounts of variance is unlikely. Ground clearance and vehicle length play a role in fuel-efficiency.

   **Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?**

The slope of the linear model is not considered zero because the p-value (5.35e-11) is smaller than the significance level.


   **Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?**

Our R-squared value is 0.715 or 71.5%. This shows the probability that future data points will fit this model which helps predict the mpg of the prototypes.

## Deliverable II: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils:

After looking at the values in the Total Summary table, it can be seen that the data does meet design specifications because the variance is 62.3 which does not exceed 100. Lot 1 and Lot 2 have specs that are within the values found in the summary table. Lot 3 shows the most variance and exceeds manufacture specifiations (170.3 variance) and does not meet design specifications.
