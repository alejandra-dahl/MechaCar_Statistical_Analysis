### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Variables or coefficients that provided a non-random amount of varience were _Ground Clearance_ and _Vehicle Length_. Their p-value is very small which means that the probability of random amounts of variance is unlikely. Ground clearance and vehicle length play a role in fuel-efficiency.

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The slope of the linear model is not considered zero because the p-value (5.35e-11) is smaller than the significance level.


### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

Our R-squared value is 0.715 or 71.5%. This shows the probability that future data points will fit this model which helps predict the mpg of the prototypes.
